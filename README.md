# Twitter Demon
Tired of losing all your followers on Twitter?! Time to win back those frenemies! The twitter demon will find out which of your friends have unfollowed you and send them a highly thought out passive-aggressive message to win them back, like: 

Still they did not come back? Time to be more aggressive!

...And if that doesnt work, maybe you should send a half-assed apology...

...well if they still don't follow you again, maybe it was an accident and they are missing out on all your great tweets! Maybe the twitter demon should PM all your tweets to them! 

That seems like a great idea!

### Todo List
- [ ] Draw out DB 
- [ ] Set up Auth0 managment api to get twitter authorization to act in behalf of authorized user
- [ ] Draw out what the app needs to do, what endpoints are needed and anything else

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
